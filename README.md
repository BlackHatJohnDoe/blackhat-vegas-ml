### Next Steps

The hardest thing to do now is to stay sharp! I have a few recommendations on next steps in order to make sure that you don't forget what we learned here! ![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/88/74/9d/88749d9e7fb7ef330b5e0b4ceb781cfd.jpg)

* Read [my book] (https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Data-Science-Sinan-Ozdemir-ebook/dp/B01A8T8YNC) ;)
* Always stay up to date on [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com)
	* Try working with some other people in this class!
	* Our Slack channel will stay around if you still want to post cool blogs, videos, etc!
* Try implementing some of the models we learned in class on your own!
	* Great book [Data Science From Scratch] (http://file.allitebooks.com/20150707/Data%20Science%20from%20Scratch-%20First%20Principles%20with%20Python.pdf) with [code](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch)

	*  Text classification with Naive Bayes from Scratch [here] (https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/naivebayes.pdf)
	*  Introduction to Statistical Learning [book](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) Videos [here](http://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/)
	*  PCA by hand [here](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_pca_step_by_step.html)
* Take a look at the **Resources** for each class to get a deeper understanding of what we've learned. Trust me there are a lot
* Follow data scientists on Twitter.  This will help you stay up on the latest news/models/applications/tools.
* Read blogs to keep learning.  I really like [District Data Labs](http://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/) and [Data Elixer](http://dataelixir.com/).
* There are some active Python Data meetups in the area:
	* [SF Python](http://www.meetup.com/sfpython/)
	* [SF Data Science](http://www.meetup.com/SF-Data-Science/)
	* [SF Data Mining](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Mining/)
	* Request sponsorship for study groups through [GA](https://gaalumni.typeform.com/to/dGyuWb)
	* [General GA Alumni Perks](http://generalassemb.ly/alumni)

	
Thank you all for such a wonderful time and I truly hope to stay in touch.
